# Table-detection-in-image-using-Python
This repository implemented Cascade TabNet using Google colab. Here we created a sreamlit application where we can upload an image file i.e invoice, report card, score card etc. which have data in table format. So this tabular data is detected by model and ready for final extraction that can be easily done with Optical Character Recogniser(OCR).
